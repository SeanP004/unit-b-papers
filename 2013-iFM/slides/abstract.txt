Title: A Step-wise Development Method with Progress Concerns

Abstract:
We present Unit-B, a formal method inspired by Event-B and UNITY, for
designing systems via step-wise refinement preserving both safety and
liveness properties.  In particular, we introduce the notion of
coarse- and fine-schedules for events, a generalisation of weak- and
strong-fairness assumptions. We propose proof rules for reasoning
about progress properties related to the schedules.  Furthermore, we
develop techniques for refining systems by adapting event schedules
such that liveness properties are preserved.  We illustrate our
approach by an example to show that Unit-B developments can be guided
by both safety and liveness requirements.
