\subsubsection{Safety}

\[ \ew{ \safety.\Prog  \3\equiv  \G (\J \lor \qexists{a}{a \in \Prog}{ a });\ctrue } \]

where $\J$ is a special atomic action which does not change the state,
i.e. satisfying
\begin{align}
  & \ew{\J \implies \X} \notag \\
  & p;\J = \J;p~, \textrm{for all state predicate $p$}~.  \label{eq:skip}
\end{align}
\eqref{eq:saf} specifies that every computation starts from a
state satisfying $\InitPred$, and every two consecutive states are
supported by an atomic action in $A$ or the special atomic
action $\J$.
