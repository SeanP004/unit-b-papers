\subsection{Method}
\label{sec:method}
Unlike in \eventB and \unity, where a development is a series of specifications where we prove the refinement relation between every consecutive pairs, in \unitb, a development is a series of application of refinement rules.  We start with an empty specification and apply refinement rules to introduce new elements or move towards a concrete design. Intermediate specifications are reached in the process but we don't need to formulate them completely as long as their components are clearly identified.
